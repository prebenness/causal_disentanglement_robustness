# Intro
This repo contains the code used in the paper:
*Measuring the Effect of Causal Disentanglement on the Adversarial Robustness of Neural Network Models*

# Basic usage
Refer to the model directories for the training, evaluation and testing scripts of each model. The disentanglement metrics used can be found in the directory *metrics*

Each model has its own requirements.txt file and should be run with its own virtualenv.
